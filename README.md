# Packer’s Survival Genesis Script
A highly customisable and mod compatible survival script with several built in features. 

### About:
The purpose of this system was to create a proper survival mode with customization and mods in mind that people could easily use to create their own survival maps without having to use a outdated (often broken) script. I’ve invested time into making this a very readable, clean and functional system that can easily be added to or removed from.
